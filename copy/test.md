## The Problem: The Conversion Killer

Every extra click is a lost sale.  
The default WooCommerce flow forces customers through **Product → Cart → Checkout**. That’s **three steps** before they even enter payment details.

Result?

- Shoppers drop off.
- Carts get abandoned.
- Revenue slips through your fingers.

FastFlow for WooCommerce cuts the process in half.

- **Direct Checkout:** Send buyers straight to checkout the moment they click “Add to Cart.”

Fewer clicks. Faster flow. More sales.
