# Change: Add Plugin Product Page

## Why

The project needs a dedicated home page variant for showcasing WooCommerce plugin products, similar to the existing test page but with full product marketing sections including hero, features, screenshots, and pricing.

## What Changes

- Add new home page at `/homes/plugin` with plugin-specific layout and content
- Create reusable components: Breadcrumb, PluginHero, FeatureCard, ScreenshotCarousel, PluginDetails
- Extract content from provided HTML template and adapt to Astro components

## Impact

- Affected specs: home-pages
- Affected code: tailwind.config.js, new components in ui/ and widgets/, new page in homes/</content>
