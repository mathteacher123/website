# Update WooCommerce Fee Use Cases and FAQs

## Summary

Update the Use Cases and Frequently Asked Questions sections in the WooCommerce Fee For Cart & Checkout plugin page to match exact source content, with professional styling using Tailwind CSS bullet points. Modify the last FAQ to indicate the option to make fees taxable.

## Motivation

Ensure the plugin page content accurately reflects the official documentation, improving user trust and conversion rates. Professional styling enhances readability without altering text.

## Impact

- Refines content accuracy for two page sections
- Improves visual presentation with styled bullet points
- No breaking changes; isolated to content updates
- Enhances SEO and user experience

## Alternatives Considered

- Keeping existing summarized content: Less accurate to source
- Plain text bullets: Less professional appearance
- Full page redesign: Unnecessary for this scope

## Implementation Plan

1. Update Use Cases descriptions with source text and Tailwind-styled ul/li
2. Update FAQs with source text, modify last item professionally
3. Test rendering in development
