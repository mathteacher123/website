# Change: Fix Plugin Page Slider and Text Styling

## Why

The /homes/plugin page has two issues: 1) The screenshot carousel slider doesn't work (navigation buttons are non-functional), and 2) Text styling doesn't match code.html exactly in terms of font properties, colors, and visual appearance.

## What Changes

- Implement functional carousel slider with JavaScript or third-party library
- Update all text elements to match exact font properties from code.html
- Ensure text colors, sizes, weights, and spacing match the original design
- Add any missing CSS for exact visual consistency

## Impact

- Affected specs: home-pages
- Affected code: src/components/widgets/ScreenshotCarousel.astro, src/pages/homes/plugin.astro, and related components
- Improves user experience and visual consistency</content>
